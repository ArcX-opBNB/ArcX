# ArcX

## Introduction
ArcX is the world's first metaverse ecosystem project to integrate physical arcade machines into Web3. Players can remotely control and play real-world arcade machines through live streaming, using just their smartphones, VR headset or computers. We are breaking down the barriers between virtual and physical gaming, creating a seamless and immersive experience for everyone.
